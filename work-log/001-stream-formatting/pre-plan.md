# Streaming Formatting

SearchAF provides an Answerbar in the package found at (`/Users/drewlanenga/Code/github.com/antflydb/colony/frontend/packages/answerbar`).  The Answerbar imports many things from this repository.

The Answerbar has a component for streaming responses (with a css class of `.searchaf-answerbar__answer`) is rendering as:

```
"For a beginner looking to learn on a board, several ChillAF snowboards are suitable:\n\n*   The
ChillAF Glide is tagged as "Beginner," "Forgiving," and """Learning" [1].\n*   The ChillAF
Foundation is also tagged as "Beginner" and "Learning," and features a "Rocker" profile [2].\n*
The ChillAF Cruise is another "Be""ginner" option noted for being "Stable" [3].\n*   The ChillAF
Spark is a "Beginner" board designed for "Freest""yle" and "Park-Intro" [4]."
```

What would be the best way to fix the formatting (double/triple quotes, newlines, raw markdown asterisks)?

Create a plan for addressing the formatting, and ask any clarifying questions you need.
